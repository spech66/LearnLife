Conway's Game of Life

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by
the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by
its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of
Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid
of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead.
Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
