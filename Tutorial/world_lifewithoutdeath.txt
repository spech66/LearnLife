Life without Death is a cellular automaton, similar to Conway's Game of Life and
other Life-like cellular automaton rules. In this cellular automaton, an initial
seed pattern grows according to the same rule as in Conway's Game of Life;
however, unlike Life, patterns never shrink. The rule was originally considered
by Toffoli & Margolus (1987), who called it "Inkspot";[1] it has also been
called "Flakes".[2] In contrast to the more complex patterns that exist within
Conway's Game of Life, Life without Death commonly features still life patterns,
in which no change occurs, and ladder patterns, that grow in a straight line.

Instead, a common feature in Life without Death patterns is the presence of
ladders, patterns that grow in a straight line. A ladder will grow forever
unless it runs into some other part of the pattern and is blocked or unless some
more quickly-growing pattern overtakes it.
