Move (or Morley) is a Life-like cellular automaton in which cells survive from
one generation to the next if they have 2, 4, or 5 neighbours. Cells are born if
they have 3, 6, or 8 neighbours. Random starting patterns tend to stabilize into
ash consisting of small still lifes and period 2 and 4 oscillators. It also
contains one commonly-occurring slow-moving spaceship and slow-moving puffer.
The time required to stabilize is generally much shorter than in the Game of
Life.
