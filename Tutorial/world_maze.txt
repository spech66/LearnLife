Maze is a Life-like cellular automaton in which cells survive from one
generation to the next if they have at least 1 and at most 5 neighbours. Cells
are born if they have exactly 3 neighbours. This resembles Conway's Game of Life
in some ways, but it is rather more difficult for cells to die off, and random
starting patterns tend to evolve into complex growing maze-like structures with
well-defined walls outlining corridors.

The maze rule is explosive, which means that most randomly-generated starting
patterns will explode in all directions. Nonetheless, there are many still lifes
and oscillators under this rule. It has no known spaceships.
