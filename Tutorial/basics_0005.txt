Since Life's inception, new similar cellular automata have been developed. The
standard Game of Life, in which a cell is "born" if it has exactly 3 neighbours,
stays alive if it has 2 or 3 living neighbours, and dies otherwise, is
symbolised as "B3/S23". The first number, or list of numbers, is what is
required for a dead cell to be born. The second set is the requirement for a
live cell to survive to the next generation. Hence "B6/S16" means "a cell is
born if there are 6 neighbours, and lives on if there are either 1 or 6
neighbours".

Sometimes the rules are written as SurvialRule/BornRule. So "Life" would be
written as 23/3.
